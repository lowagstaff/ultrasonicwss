## Overview

**Project Title**: Ultrasonic WSS

**Project Description**: I wanted to recreate a WSS with arduino. I used an ultrasonic sensor to represent the magnet and reluctor assembly. I have the readings of close (1) and far (0) which are similar to a real life WSS. I have the results printed to an LCD screen. It also prints a waveform of High and Low similar to a real WSS reading, as well as revolutions per a 36 tooth axle. 

**Project Goals**: Understand arduino/C/C++ for future employment opportunitites as an automotive engineer. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Follow link: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gS8eUGQTQ6R-mighty-kieran/editel?tenant=circuits
2. Press the "Start Simulation" button on the top right of the screen. 
3.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Once you press the "Start Simulation" button, click on the ultrasonic sensor and it should pop up a dot with a cone.
2. Click and hold on the dot and move it in and out of the cone to represent a reading that will print to the LCD.
3.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* No software requirements or library requirements
* Possible TinkerCad account needed. 
*

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Arduino Progress Bar Graph Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKP1AA-hizw&t=1060s)
* [Arduino Intro: LCD Custom Character Binary Matrix Generator](https://arduinointro.com/lcdcustomcharacter/)
* 

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Creating a program to track RPM instead of only revolutions. 
* [ ] Make this in real life and try to connect an actual wheel speed sensor instead of an ultrasonic sensor. 
* [ ]
